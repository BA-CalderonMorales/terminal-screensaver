## Project Standards and Requirements

### CRITICAL: No Emojis Policy

**IMPORTANT**: This project has a strict **NO EMOJIS** policy that applies to ALL contributions.

#### What This Means:
- **NO emojis in commit messages**: Use descriptive text only
- **NO emojis in code comments**: Professional documentation standards
- **NO emojis in documentation**: Text-only communication
- **NO emojis in pull request descriptions**: Clear, professional descriptions
- **NO emojis in issue reports**: Technical descriptions without emojis
- **NO emojis in code**: This includes string literals, constants, and output

#### Examples of INCORRECT Usage:
```
‚ùå "Add cool feature üöÄ"
‚ùå "Fix bug üêõ in screensaver"
‚ùå "Update docs üìö"
‚ùå println!("Welcome! üëã");
‚ùå // TODO: Make this faster ‚ö°
```

#### Examples of CORRECT Usage:
```
‚úì "Add dynamic screen resizing feature"
‚úì "Fix rendering bug in alpha feature"
‚úì "Update documentation for CLI interface"
‚úì println!("Welcome to Terminal Screensaver");
‚úì // TODO: Optimize rendering performance
```

#### Pull Request Review Process:
- PRs containing emojis will be **automatically rejected**
- Contributors will be asked to remove ALL emojis before review
- This policy is non-negotiable and applies to all contributors

### Code Quality Standards

#### Formatting and Style
- **Rust Code**: Must pass `cargo fmt --check`
- **Documentation**: Follow project documentation standards
- **Commit Messages**: Use conventional commit format without emojis
- **Line Length**: Maximum 100 characters for code, 80 for documentation

#### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: All new functionality must include unit tests
- **Integration Tests**: CLI and feature changes require integration tests
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain minimum 90% coverage for new code
- **Documentation Tests**: All code examples in docs must be tested

#### Security Requirements
- **No Secrets**: Never commit sensitive information
- **Input Validation**: All user input must be validated and sanitized
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Dependency Audit**: New dependencies must pass security audit

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention
- **Feature branches**: `feature/descriptive-name`
- **Bug fixes**: `fix/issue-description`
- **Documentation**: `docs/section-update`
- **Refactoring**: `refactor/component-name`

### Commit Message Format
```
type(scope): brief description

Detailed explanation of changes if needed.

Closes #123
```

**Types**: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
**Scope**: feature name, component, or area affected

### Pull Request Process

#### Before Submitting
1. **Run Local CI**: Execute `./scripts/local-ci.sh` successfully
2. **Test Changes**: Verify all tests pass locally
3. **Update Documentation**: Update relevant documentation
4. **Self-Review**: Review your own changes thoroughly
5. **Emoji Check**: Ensure NO emojis anywhere in your changes

## Project Architecture Guidelines

### Screaming Architecture
Follow the established project structure where the codebase immediately reveals business intent:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature_*/           # Feature-specific implementations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/             # Cross-feature utilities (not tightly coupled)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles/             # UI styling and theming
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cli/                # Command-line interface logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logger/             # Centralized logging infrastructure
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.rs            # Application entry point
```

### Feature Development
- **New Features**: Create in dedicated `feature_*` directories
- **Shared Code**: Add to `src/shared/` only if truly reusable
- **Testing**: Co-locate tests with implementation
- **Documentation**: Update relevant docs in `docs/` directory

### Plugin Architecture
- **Host Integration**: Maintain clean separation from host applications
- **Configuration**: Use TOML configuration for customization
- **Minimal Defaults**: ESC key always available, additional options configurable

## Common Contribution Areas

### Documentation Improvements
- **API Documentation**: Rust doc comments for public APIs
- **User Guides**: Clear, step-by-step instructions
- **Examples**: Working code examples that demonstrate features
- **Architecture Docs**: Updates to `docs/` directory files

### Bug Fixes
- **Issue Reproduction**: Clear steps to reproduce the bug
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Understanding of why the bug occurred
- **Testing**: Comprehensive tests to prevent regression
- **Documentation**: Update docs if behavior changes

### New Features
- **Design Discussion**: Open an issue for design discussion first
- **Implementation Plan**: Break down into smaller, reviewable changes
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing API compatibility
- **Configuration**: Add TOML configuration options as needed

### Performance Improvements
- **Benchmarking**: Include before/after performance measurements
- **Testing**: Ensure no functionality regressions
- **Documentation**: Document any API changes
- **Compatibility**: Maintain terminal compatibility
