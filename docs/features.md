### Configuration Example

```toml
text = "Professional Terminal Screensaver"
style = "default"

[[actions]]
key = "d"
description = "Development Environment Status"
command = "./scripts/dev-status.sh"

[[actions]]
key = "g"
description = "Git Quick Actions"
command = "./scripts/git-quick.sh"

[[actions]]
key = "h"
description = "Help Information"
command = "./scripts/help.sh"
```

### Demo Scripts Included

1. **dev-status.sh**: Development environment overview
2. **git-quick.sh**: Interactive Git operations
3. **help.sh**: Feature documentation and usage guide

### Usage

```bash
# Run with script integration
cargo run --release -- -c demo-config.toml

# Interactive demo

## Architecture Notes

This feature enhancement transforms the terminal screensaver from a simple display tool into a powerful, extensible productivity hub while maintaining its professional appearance and minimal configuration requirements.

The implementation follows the project's Screaming Architecture principles, where the codebase structure immediately communicates the business domain and intent. All features are designed with:

- Clear separation of concerns
- Feature-based organization
- Testable components
- Shared utilities without tight coupling
- Maintainable logging infrastructure
